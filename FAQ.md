# NeuroZKP FAQ

## What is NeuroZKP?
NeuroZKP is a privacy-first infrastructure company focused on applying zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to neural data, brain-computer interfaces, and decentralized identity systems.

## Why does neural data need privacy protection?
Neural data is deeply personal and sensitive. Without robust safeguards, it can be exploited for surveillance, manipulation, or unauthorized profiling.

## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?
ZKPs are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove something is true without revealing the underlying data. NeuroZKP uses them to verify neural signals and identities without exposing raw brain data.

## Is NeuroZKP compliant with GDPR and other regulations?
Yes. Our infrastructure is designed to meet global privacy standards, including GDPR, HIPAA, and emerging neurotech-specific regulations.

## Who is NeuroZKP for?
We serve developers, researchers, and companies building brain-computer interfaces, cognitive biometrics, and privacy-preserving AI systems.

## Does NeuroZKP have open-source components?
Yes. Our GitHub presence includes core libraries and documentation to support transparency and community collaboration.

## Where is NeuroZKP based?
We operate remotely, with our team distributed globally. Our registered business information is available to relevant authorities and partners on request, but we do not have a public walk-in office.

## Why don’t you list a physical address?
Because our services are entirely digital, we prioritise secure online channels for communication. Public addresses are often targeted for scams, spam, or security risks, so we protect our team by using virtual and verifiable contact methods instead.

## How can I verify you are legitimate?
Our website uses SSL encryption (padlock icon in your browser). Our domains are officially registered and traceable via WHOIS (with privacy protection). We publish regular updates via our verified social media accounts. We welcome due-diligence checks from partners and collaborators.

## How do I contact you?
Email us at info@neurozkp.com or via our verified social profiles. We respond within 24–48 hours.

## How do you protect my information?
We follow GDPR-compliant privacy practices, use encrypted communication channels, and never share personal data without explicit consent.
